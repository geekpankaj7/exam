There are four assumptions associated with a linear regression model:

Linearity: The relationship between X and the mean of Y is linear.
Homoscedasticity: The variance of residual is the same for any value of X.
Independence: Observations are independent of each other.
Normality: For any fixed value of X, Y is normally distributed.


Assumptions of linear regression
● The dependent variable must be numeric
● Linear relationship between dependent and independent variables
● Predictors must not show multicollinearity
● Independence of observations should exist (Absence of Autocorrelation)
● The error terms should be homoscedastic
● The error terms must follow normal distribution
