What is multicollinearity?
● Multicollinearity arises when the independent variables have high correlation among each other
● Multicollinearity may be introduced if there exists empirical relationship among variables such as income = expenditure + saving
● In presence of it, the best fit line obtained from OLS method is no more “best”
● Also, the confidence interval obtained for β’s is wider since the SE(β) becomes large
